        "Rugby also called as Rugby Union is a contact team sport which was originated from England. The game is played by 15 players aside. It is considered as one of the tough, strong, and fast interaction games. The games provide players to improve their physical condition, speed, agility and endurance. Moreover, as the game is played with the team, the performance as an individual is as important as the overall performance as a team. The players support each other mentally and physically. Moreover, for most effective scoring player coordination plays a vital role. The communication among the team and identifying sudden changes made by a team member and adjust according is essential during a rugby game. \n",
        "\n",
        "Currently the game is played by 101 countries and among that Australia is one of the oldest countries who is still playing Rugby since 1899. Rugby Australia’s elite teams’ objective is to build sustainable success in the professional game. Hence, the management has invested in coaching staff as well as technology as well. \n",
        "\n",
        "In January 2019, Rugby Australia initiated a high-performance unit involving data analytics for training and planning by their coaching staff. The main purpose of this project is to improve player’s skills and performance, mentally and physically. The analytics team has collected training data, player performance data, wellness data, and GPS data of the players (Braue 2018). The platform is created to store all the big data and visualise data in my several ways so that coaching staff has the ability to make insightful decisions. This system has made the decision making of the coaching staff effective and efficient. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, with the game situation, players tend to get injured during competitions and also get tired up during the game. Therefore, the coaching staff need to change players time to time without harming the team performance and dynamics. Hence, the supporting staff find it difficult to find suitable players and new players who can be played together with strong connection. Therefore, the proposed system can be really helpful to evaluate the players and predict which players can play together as well as which players are the most influential during the game. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are many academic researches done in player performance prediction in team sports as well as individual sports. For football, performance prediction was done using a linear regression model (Pariath et al. 2018). Pariath has suggested to divide the models according to player role since the different positions has different key attributes. Another player performance prediction was done using random forest and XGBoost models for NBA players (Oughali, Bahloul & Rahman 2019). In these studies, the players performance was considered from an individual perspective. Although, the player performance depends on the team players as well. Therefore, the project focuses on player performance prediction in the team working perspective. \n",
        "\n",
        "Passos has pointed out that players interactions can be considered as complex social networks (Passos et al. 2011). Moreover, the author has considered the intentional and unintentional coordination behaviours during the game. Also, that the interactions can be changed during the game according the nature of the game as well. The same idea can be put in to Rugby player interactions as well. According to the nature of rugby, the players performance can alter. Hence, using player coordination prediction along with performance using complex networks can be identified as suitable methods. \n",

        "\n",
        "As mentioned above, there are many performance predictions for sports. However, player prediction is somewhat lacking in rugby. The main reason is the dynamic in the game. For an example, a forward whose role is to defend and push forward with the strength. However, the same player can be in the backs to move the ball forward as a sprinter. Therefore, the player performance is considered as a team with team coordination among players. This area of studies can be considered as innovative in the academic area as well in rugby."
