        "Rugby also called as Rugby Union is a contact team sport which was originated from England. The game is played by 15 players aside. It is considered as one of the tough, strong, and fast interaction games. The games provide players to improve their physical condition, speed, agility and endurance. Moreover, in the game, the performance as an individual is as important as the overall performance as a team. The players support each other mentally and physically. Moreover, for most effective scoring player coordination plays a vital role. The communication among the team and identifying sudden changes made by a team member and adjust according is essential during a rugby game. \n",
        "\n",
        "Currently, the game is played by 101 countries and among that Australia is one of the oldest countries which is still playing Rugby since 1899. Rugby Australia’s elite teams’ objective is to build sustainable success in the professional game. Hence, the management has invested in the coaching staff as well as technology as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "In January 2019, Rugby Australia initiated a high-performance unit involving data analytics for training and planning by their coaching staff. The primary purpose of this project is to improve the player’s skills and performance, mentally and physically. The analytics team has collected training data, player performance data, wellness data, and GPS data of the players. The platform is created to store all the big data and visualise data in several ways so that coaching staff can make insightful decisions. This system has made the decision making of the coaching staff effective and efficient. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, with the game situation, players tend to get injured during competitions and also get tired up during the game. Therefore, the coaching staff need to change players from time to time without harming the team performance and dynamics. Hence, the supporting staff find it challenging to find suitable players and new players who can be played together with a strong connection. \n"
